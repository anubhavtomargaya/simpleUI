## Context

Contains the projects I created while experimenting with learning HTML/CSS/JS, before moving to React(or other JS frameworks) it seemed like a good idea to understand JavaScript and Modern UI design principles. Since last I learned CSS/HTML (back in middle school) a lot has changed and this exercise turned into milking the most out of these simple languages(?) and being amazed by the possibilities. 
Note: Everything from 2020-21 i.e. extra liesurely pandemic times. Not updated as of writing this but will be updated the next time I get pulled into working with JS.
